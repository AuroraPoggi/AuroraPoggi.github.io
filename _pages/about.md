<h3> I'm Aurora Poggi, </h3>

a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. 

My research focuses on Inverse Problem, High Dimensional Probability and Dynamical Systems. 


My studies started in 2017, attending the Bachelor Degree of <h4>Applied Mathematics</h4> with a curriculum in <h4>Economics and Finance</h4>. During my bachelorâ€™s degree I followed several courses concerning Finance and Stochastic calculus; at the end I did a thesis concerning the latter entitled <em>Deterministic and stochastic models for opinion making</em> with Professor <h4>[Paolo Dai Pra](https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=11481)</h4>.

Following that, I enrolled in the Applied Mathematics Master Program, where I focused on AI applications.
In addition, I took part in the <h4>Erasmus + Study</h4> program at the <h4>University of Oslo</h4> (UiO), where I attended the courses <em>Adaptive methods for data-based decision making</em> and <em>Interest Rate Modelling via SPDEs</em>.

My Master's Thesis was conducted at the <h4>Bergische UniversitÃ¤t Wuppertal</h4> entitled <h4>Electricity Price Forecasting via statistical and deep learning approaches: the German case</h4> under the supervision of <h4> [Prof. Matthias Ehrhardt](https://ehrhardt.uni-wuppertal.de)</h4>. The internship in Germany introduced me to the academic world, which turned out to be extremely interesting and inspiring.

During my Masterâ€™s degree I also had the possibility to attend a course about Modeling Epidemics in collaboration with the <h4>Gran Sasso Science Institute</h4>. Moreover, I attended the <h4>ECMI Modelling week</h4> (3rd - 9th July Verona). During this conference week, I carried out a group project named <em>Deep Learning for Modeling Filamentous Sludge Bulking</em> with a team of Masterâ€™s students, PhD students, Professors and several Industries which allowed me to understand the dynamics of a research group and the coordination work that underlies it.Â Â 


This PhD position is funded by the <h4>Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program</h4> (WASP). The graduate school within WASP is dedicated to providing the skills needed to analyze, develop, and contribute to the interdisciplinary area of artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and software. The graduate school actively supports forming a strong multi-disciplinary and international professional network between PhD students.
