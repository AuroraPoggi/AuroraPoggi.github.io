<h3> I'm Aurora Poggi, </h3>
<p>
a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. 
<br>
My research focuses on Inverse Problem, High Dimensional Probability and Dynamical Systems. 
</p>

<p>
My studies started in 2017, attending the Bachelor Degree of <strong> Applied Mathematics </strong> with a curriculum in <strong> Economics and Finance </strong>. During my bachelorâ€™s degree I followed several courses concerning Finance and Stochastic calculus; at the end I did a thesis concerning the latter entitled <em>Deterministic and stochastic models for opinion making</em> with Professor <strong> [Paolo Dai Pra] (https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=11481)  </strong>.
<br>
Following that, I enrolled in the <strong> Applied Mathematics </strong> Master Program, where I focused on AI applications.
In addition, I took part in the <strong> Erasmus + Study </strong> program at the <strong> University of Oslo </strong> (UiO), where I attended the courses <em> Adaptive methods for data-based decision making </em> and <em> Interest Rate Modelling via SPDEs </em>.
<br>
My Master's Thesis was conducted at the <strong> Bergische UniversitÃ¤t Wuppertal </strong> entitled <em> Electricity Price Forecasting via statistical and deep learning approaches: the German case </em> under the supervision of <strong> [Prof. Matthias Ehrhardt] (https://ehrhardt.uni-wuppertal.de) </strong>. The internship in Germany introduced me to the academic world, which turned out to be extremely interesting and inspiring.
<br>
During my Masterâ€™s degree I also had the possibility to attend a course about Modeling Epidemics in collaboration with the <strong> Gran Sasso Science Institute </strong>. Moreover, I attended the <strong> ECMI Modelling week </strong> (3rd - 9th July Verona). During this conference week, I carried out a group project named <em> Deep Learning for Modeling Filamentous Sludge Bulking </em> with a team of Masterâ€™s students, PhD students, Professors and several Industries which allowed me to understand the dynamics of a research group and the coordination work that underlies it.Â Â
