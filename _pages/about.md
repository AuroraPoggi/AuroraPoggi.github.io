<h3> I'm Aurora Poggi, </h3>
<p>
a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. 
<br>
My research focuses on Inverse Problem, High Dimensional Probability and Dynamical Systems. 
</p>

<p>
My studies started in 2017, attending the Bachelor Degree of <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> with a curriculum in <strong>Economics and Finance</strong> at <strong>UniversitÃ  degli studi di Verona</strong>, concluded with a thesis entitled <em>Deterministic and stochastic models for opinion making</em> with Professor <strong><a href="https://www.di.univr.it/?ent=persona&id=11481">Paolo Dai Pra</a></strong>.
<br>
Following that, I enrolled in the <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> Master Program, where I focused on applications of AI.
During my second year, I participated in the <strong>Erasmus+ Study</strong> programme at the <strong>University of Oslo</strong> (UiO) and the <strong>Erasmus+ Traineeship</strong> at the <strong>Bergische UniversitÃ¤t Wuppertal</strong>, where I wrote my Master's Thesis entitled <em>Electricity Price Forecasting via statistical and deep learning approaches: the German case</em> under the supervision of Professor <strong><a href="https://ehrhardt.uni-wuppertal.de">Matthias Ehrhardt</a></strong>. The internship in Germany introduced me to the academic world, which turned out to be extremely interesting and inspiring.
<br>
During my Masterâ€™s degree I also had the possibility to attend a course about Modeling Epidemics in collaboration with the <strong>Gran Sasso Science Institute</strong>. Lastly, I attended the <strong>ECMI Modelling week</strong> (3rd - 9th July Verona) where we carried out a group project named <em>Deep Learning for Modeling Filamentous Sludge Bulking</em> with a team of Masterâ€™s students, Professors and several Industries.
