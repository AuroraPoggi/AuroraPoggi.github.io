MSML2025 is the fifth edition of a recently established international conference, with an emphasis on promoting the study of mathematical theory and algorithms of machine learning, as well as applications of machine learning in scientific computing and engineering disciplines. I presented a poster with title <em> Data-driven multi-agent modelling of calcium interactions in cell culture: Regularized Least-Squares vs PINN</em> .
